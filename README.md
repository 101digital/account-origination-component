AccountOriginationService.instance().initClients({
  contactBaseUrl: "url"
});

### Assets And Multiple Languages

- In order to do multiple languages, you need to configurate `i18n` for [react-native-theme-component](https://github.com/101digital/react-native-theme-component.git). And then, you have to copy and paste all fields and values in [texts](customer-invoke-data.json) into your app locale file. You can also change text value, but DON'T change the key.
